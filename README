libcmyth example application for Android
----------------------------------------

This is a very simple example application for how to use libcmyth with
Android and JNI.

To build this application, you will first need to clone the libcmyth git
repository, https://github.com/cmyth, into jni/cmyth:

	$ git clone git://github.com/cmyth/cmyth.git jni/cmyth

Then you can build the application:

	$ make

And install the application either on your simulator or your device:

	$ make sim_update
	$ make hw_update

Please note that video playback is done via an intent, which means you will
need a video player capable of playing your recordings via http.  I would
suggest MX Video Player, but other video applications should work as well.
