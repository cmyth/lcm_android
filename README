libcmyth example application for Android
----------------------------------------

This is a very simple example application for how to use libcmyth with
Android and JNI.

In order to build this, you will need the following installed on your
system and available in your $PATH:

	- Android SDK
	- Android NDK
	- scons
	- swig

To build this application, you will first need to clone the libcmyth
repository with support for generating Java bindings via SWIG.  You can
get this by doing the following:

	$ git clone git://github.com/gettler/cmyth.git cmyth

Then you can build the application, which will also build libcmyth and
the Java bindings:

	$ make

And install the application either on your simulator or your device:

	$ make sim
	$ make hw

You can also update the application either on your simulator or device:

	$ make sim_update
	$ make hw_update

Please note that video playback is done via an intent, which means you will
need a video player capable of playing your recordings via http.  I would
suggest MX Video Player, but other video applications should work as well.
